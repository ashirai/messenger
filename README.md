![](http://realestatopia.com/images/messenger.jpg)

This is a simple demo of a web based messanger.

## Technology Used
- Angular.js 1.4.3
- .NET 4.5 (C#)
- SignalR 2.0

## What is SignalR?
SignalR is a set of server and client libraries that facilitate simple, real-time, two-way communications between server and client. Not only can the client initiate contact with the server, as is the case in Web development, but the server can also contact the client. Those arenâ€™t just simple HTTP responses, either. These are actual method calls from server to client, like push technology. Clients can even contact other clients through the SignalR server-side component. All this is possible because SignalR creates a persistent connection between the server and client.

## System Requirements

### Supported operating System
- Windows Server 2012
- Windows Server 2008 r2
- Windows 8
- Windows 7
- Windows Azure

### Supported .NET Framework version
SignalR 2 is only supported on .NET Famework 4.5.

### Supported IIS versions
- IIS 8 or IIS 8 Express.
- IIS 7 and 7.5. Support for extensionless URLs is required.
- IIS must be running in integrated mode.
- The hosting application must be running in full trust mode.

### Supported Web Browsers
SignalR can be used in a variety of web browsers, but typically, only the latest two versions are supported.

## How to test demo
1. Open Messenger.sln in Visual Studio
2. Build the solution
3. Start debugging
4. When a browser window opens, copy the url into another browser window
5. Select a different user for each window (so that you can see different people are talking to each other).
6. Now enter a message in each window to see if those messages are broadcasted to each window
